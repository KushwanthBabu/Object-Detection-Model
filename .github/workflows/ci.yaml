# This workflow runs on every push or pull request to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  build:
    # The type of virtual machine to run the job on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: Checks out your repository's code so the job can access it
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Sets up a specific version of Python
    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    # Step 3: Installs the Python libraries listed in requirements.txt
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Step 4 (Optional but recommended): Lints the code to check for style errors
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        pip install flake8
        # Stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # Exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
